# Budget Planner

The objective of this project is to maintain a well-rounded budget planner to keep track of 
purchases, deposits, and bills. Creating this budget plan will allow you to determine in 
advance whether you will have enough money to do the things you need to do or would like to do.
Be able to see what stores are having the best sales and see what gas stations have the lowest 
gas prices.
